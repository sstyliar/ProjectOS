============================================================================================

  **SINGLE PLAYER PART**

		DONE->	*Functionality to create 2d array with the maze values.
					
		ABORTED->	*Add it to show_saveMaze...probably better in the read_file.

		DONE->	*Make if statments for wall detection/hit wall prevention before 
		 		 players movement.

		DONE->	*Figure out how to add loot and monsters.
					(Maybe from the array before while(keyboard input chech).

		DONE->	*Make if statements for monster/boss/loot detection/guestion before fighting (y/n).			

		DONE->	*Figure out how to delete previous player position from the terminal.
			
		DONE->	*Figure out how to refresh/erase outpout window text in case of change.

		DONE->	*Change show_saveMaze to only save maze in files, script destination->Server.

		DONE->	*Reminder: Disable temp_maze display in window Maze.

		DONE->	*Fix bugs with player movements. Player carves the maze as he passes. 

		DONE->	*Add restrictions as to how many lesser monsters per maze depending on level.
					Level 1 -> 0 lesser monsters, level 2 -> 1 lesser monsters, etc. 

		DONE->	*Add new column to window stats for the mosnters and boss health bars.

		DONE->	*Remove monsters and loot if user declines.

		DONE->	*Fix bug where is gives segmentation fault when trying to display bigger than 15x15 maze.

  **MULTIPLAYER PART**





=====================
VASILW
=====================

	*Make new function for fighting calculations.






====================
XRHSTOS
====================

	*Set initial monster/boss stats values (atck,armor,health,accur,lvl) inside their respective structs for level 1.
		
	*Make new function to handle the increase in difficulty per level in terms of monsters/boss stats.

	*Combine previous function with monsterRestriction( ln. 640 ).
		Make it the monsterRestriction value and assign stats values.
			For exmaple if level = 1 then no monsters allowed.
			If level = 2, one monster allowed with health = 90; armor = 45; attack = 60; accurasy = 100; level = 1;
			Or some shit like that, numbers are going to change anyways.

	*Dynamically set player/vasilw/boss stats 
	*CLEAN-UP.
	*Make the MAKEFILE.
	*Go to Fiji.
