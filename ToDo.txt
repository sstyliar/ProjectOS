========================
*********VASILW*********
========================

	DONE->	*Make new function for fighting calculations.

	*Sockets galore...nough said.






=======================
********XRHSTOS********
=======================

	*Add functionality to auto-login if the user desires after the registering is done.

	*Make new function to handle the increase in difficulty per level in terms of monsters/boss stats.

	*Combine previous function with monsterRestriction( ln. 640 ).
		Make it the monsterRestriction value and assign stats values.
			For exmaple if level = 1 then no monsters allowed.
			If level = 2, one monster allowed with health = 90; armor = 45; attack = 60; accurasy = 100; level = 1;
			Or some shit like that, numbers are going to change anyways.

	*DELETE everything but the positions & level from humanInit function cause human values
	 are assigned by the user manually.

	*Dynamically set player/vasilw/boss stats.

	*CLEAN-UP.

	*Make the MAKEFILE.

	*Go to Fiji.
